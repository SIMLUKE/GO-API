### GO rest api
- This is my first project in go
- It was done over the course of the software pool of epitech's POC where the goal was to create a full stack website in 24 hours
- You can find out how the api works with the wiki
## How to use
- This project is fully hosted on docker, to try it, use the command ```docker compose up --build```
